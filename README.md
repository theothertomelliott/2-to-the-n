# 2^n
A silly clone of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), based on [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made for the sake of the exercise, but heck, it might be fun too [Play it here!](http://theothertomelliott.github.io/)

## Contributing

I'd welcome contributions to my fork, but if you've got a great idea, the [original game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) would probably benefit more, then I can pull changes into this version too!
