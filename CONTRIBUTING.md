## Contributing
Changes and improvements are more than welcome! Feel free to fork and open a pull request. Please make your changes in a specifically made branch and request to pull on `master`! If you can, please make sure the game fully works before sending the PR, as that will help speed up the process.

However, if you've got a great idea, the [original game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) would probably benefit more, then I can pull changes into this version too!
